# aql-vim
A simple vim syntax highlighting config for AQL (ArangoDB Query Language), the language used for querying [ArangoDB](http://www.arangodb.com)

I could point you to the emacs one, but if you're here why would you want or need to go there?

### Installation

This repository should be compatible with most Vim package managers. For example, with dein:

```vim
call dein#add('devyn/aql-vim')
```
